## How to use Boring Avatars service

To generate an avatar just embed following URL `https://avatar.tobi.sh/`. Now you can append a username to generate an avatar

To generate a custom avatar just embed the following URL `https://img.boringavatars.com/` and append a variant, size and a username to generate a custom avatar.

### Custom variant

```
https://img.boringavatars.com/marble
```

### Custom size

```
https://img.boringavatars.com/marble/120

```

### With name

Each name will generate a unique `avatar`. Just replace `haykan` with an `username` or `email`


```
https://img.boringavatars.com/marble/120/haykan
```

### Random avatar
If you just want to use random avatars without providing usernames, you can use the root endpoint. You will receive an `svg` image with a 80*80px size using the `marble` variant.
